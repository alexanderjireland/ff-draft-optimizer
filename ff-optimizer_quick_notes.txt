ff-optimizer_quick_notes

Get to do list going!

Add .pkl file data collection nb from midcourse project to this repository?

Could incorporate probability a player gets injured into Bayesian regression model. (Hurdle model??)

Begin MARL work (systematically!)

Start with:
- Two player draft environment
- Player position, exp. rank, exp. ff pts?
- Keep it simple!

Questions:
- How to reward policy?
- Should we reward within draft?
	- Random pt from pt distribution
	- Actual outcome
- Reward based on rank?
	-Actual optimized season score
- Reward scaled optimized season score
- PPO? DQN? Lots to learn!
